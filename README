A simple archiving proxy.  It saves pretty much everything that goes through it.

To save only selective sites or sections of sites, edit the proxy.pac in this directory as you see fit and add:
http://localhost:8000/proxy.pac
as your automatic proxy config URL.  Every time you start your browser while archiverProxy is running, it will get the file.
If it isn't running, then your computer goes ahead with business as usual.
